# Overview

<!-- img class="overview-image" src="" -->

This lesson uses the [**Explore PT Survival Guide - Student Guide**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LXdGESIW-vjEiE3Qzvvml2305inbKUbffQBd19Bg1jE/) as the backbone for a series of activities to ramp up to doing the actual Explore PT. It contains some brainstorming activities around what qualifies as a "computing innovation" for the task as well practical advice and strategies for handling some of the nuances of the task such as distinguising between a "harmful effect" and a "data security or privacy concern."
